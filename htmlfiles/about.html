        <h1 style="color: aliceblue;" style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Hello there welcome to my webpage.</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p> My name is umesh das and i am from Jharkhand,India. I am happy that you visited my webpage.
            I am a male of age 17. I love to watch anime in free times. I also love to read finnacial books.
            I learn Webdevelopment from an online website(udemy). That course was really great.
            I live in a village name Darkhuli which is 96km(approx) from Jamshedpur.
            I love to visit place which are less crowded i kinda don't like to visit 
            crowdy area cause you will not get peace if there are people around.
            I am a ambiovert with good enough confidence to talk with strange people.
            When i was in 10th standard i like to study so i became school topper.
            But after 10th i started to neglect studies and start learning some new skills
            but the neglectness now make my studies hateful for me. In class 10th my favourite 
            subject was Math i still like Math but not that much as i do before. </p>
